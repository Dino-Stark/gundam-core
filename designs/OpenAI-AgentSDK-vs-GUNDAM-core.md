# OpenAI Agents SDK vs GUNDAM-core

This document compares the current capabilities of:

- **OpenAI Agents SDK** (reference source in `references/openai-agents-python-main`)
- **GUNDAM-core** (`generic-agent-core`, Java runtime in `src/main/java`)

## Scope

- OpenAI side: Python SDK architecture/features used as baseline reference.
- GUNDAM-core side: Java runtime kernel + executable streaming examples in `src/test/java/.../examples`.

| Spring AI tool/chat compatibility | ⚪ | ✅ | `SpringAiToolAdapters`, `SpringAiChatClientLlmClient` (GUNDAM-specific advantage). |
| Multimodal generation providers | ✅ | 🟡 Partial | Interfaces are present; provider-side full implementations are still evolving. |

## Current GUNDAM-core profile

### Context model clarification

- GUNDAM-core now uses **one runtime context class**: `AgentRunnerContext`.
- Lifecycle hooks and guardrails now take `AgentRunnerContext` directly.
- `AgentRunnerContext` centralizes both execution state (`currentAgent`, `memory`, `usageTracker`, `currentStep`) and run orchestration state (`events`, `items`, `turns`).
- Conversation payloads are now normalized on **`ContextItem` only** (the previous `model.Message` class has been removed).
- `ContextItem` now carries message-role semantics (`role`, `parts`, `toolCalls`, `toolCallId`) and item semantics (`type`, `metadata`) so runtime memory, context builders, and provider adapters share one contract.
- This removes the previous dual-class split and avoids context bridging/allocation inside `AgentRunner`.

### Strongly implemented today

1. Runtime orchestration kernel (`AgentRunner`) with streaming/non-streaming parity.
2. Tool and agent composition primitives (local tools, agent-as-tool, workflow-as-tool).
3. Safety/control plane (guardrails, approval policies, retries, typed error handlers).
4. Observability plane (events, tracing, token accounting, tool-use tracking).
5. Provider-agnostic model layer with multiple adapters.
6. Session/memory foundations including memory lifecycle policy support.

### Implemented with evolving breadth

- MCP ecosystem support (multiple transports, approvals, manager/proxy contracts).
- Workflow DAG runtime and processor ecosystem.
- RAG/vector foundations and multimodal message contracts.

### Partial/scaffolding areas

- Realtime full session workflow.
- Voice pipeline implementation.
- Provider-specific implementations for audio/image/video generation.

## Recent reliability improvements (ReAct debug examples)

- `ApplyPatchTool` now aligns with OpenAI hosted apply_patch validation/output semantics (`create_file|update_file|delete_file` + `{status,output}`), while also accepting flat/raw payload fallbacks to improve model-call robustness in function-call providers.
- ReAct default prompt instructions were tightened to prefer concise internal reasoning and short final summaries instead of verbose thought transcripts.
- `Example24`, `Example25`, and `Example33` debug-fix flows now use lower-turn/lower-token configs and stronger patch-call guidance to reduce wasted deliberation while preserving streaming behavior.
- `Example25` now uses a multi-agent ReAct topology (coordinator/investigator/fixer/reviewer), includes source snapshots, and logs thought/action/observation output and provides explicit behavior-contract bug hints to make root-cause diagnosis and runtime verification traceable.
- The same three examples now validate concise runtime and concise structured summaries (`Problem`/`Fix`/`Verification` style) to better enforce “understand + fix + verify + summarize” outcomes.

## Example coverage alignment

The examples package contains **33 streaming-oriented test cases** (`Example01` ~ `Example33`) demonstrating the maturity areas above, including:

- basic and multi-round agent loops,
- tools and MCP,
- handoffs and multi-provider runs,
- tracing,
- structured output,
- multimodal input/output,
- RAG,
- tool use tracking,
- patch/computer/pdf/web-search tools,
- ReAct-style debugging (including planner-first 4-agent mode),
- agent/workflow composition patterns.

## Recommended next roadmap

1. **Realtime completion**: finalize `IRealtimeClient` / `IRealtimeSession` implementations and durable transport behaviors.
2. **Voice pipeline completion**: integrate STT/TTS providers and streaming audio lifecycle.
3. **Multimodal provider depth**: add concrete `IImageGenerator`, `IAudioGenerator`, `IVideoGenerator` adapters.
4. **Production hardening**: concurrency/fault-injection/performance benchmarking on non-memory backends.
5. **Capability governance**: introduce compatibility test suites that continuously compare target behavior against OpenAI Agents SDK semantics.
