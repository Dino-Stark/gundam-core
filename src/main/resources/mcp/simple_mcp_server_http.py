"""
A simple MCP server for testing purposes using SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport.
Provides basic tools: add, echo, kb_search, and policy_lookup.

Requirements:
    pip install mcp[cli] uvicorn

Usage:
    python simple_mcp_server_http.py [port]

The server uses SSE transport for HTTP communication.
Default port is 8765.
